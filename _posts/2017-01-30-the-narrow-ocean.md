Rain shatters on the pavement gray:  
The motor sounds and soft decay  
Of deep-set love and shallow starts  
Converging, as we both depart  

To separate rooms on separate ends   
Of island lands of winter rain;  
Warm fingers held in quiet spells,  
Sweet memoirs I resort to quell.  

Yet sorrow not, forlornness not,  
Descends here, ever-surely  
But soft, slow spells of ennui  
Without you here beside me.  

Soles shuddering on puddled lanes,  
They march for my devotion:  
That I should wander back to you  
Across the narrow ocean.
