A stilted stone, perched still  
on the tracks. Bare forms    
on narrow platforms  
as air whistles: you sway,  
you sway.

That is day; when dusk stutters  
we stagger in lurches  
ebb sideways into byways  
of smoke and light and chatter. Yes,  

the night we met. The clatter  
of chess pieces and glass  
cascading, one by one,  
a false embrace, the stilted  
Irish tongue,  

There are no trains here, just  
walk, walk, walk.  
The train passes. You and  
dawn lifting away. Left  
behind, your musk,  
and one stilted stone.
