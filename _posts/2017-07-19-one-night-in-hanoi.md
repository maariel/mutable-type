A stilted stone, perching still  
on the tracks. Pacing  
marches on the platform.  
The air whistles, you sway,  
you sway.

That is day, when dusk stutters  
in we stagger in lurches  
ebb backwards and sideways  
outside repose. Yes,  

the night we met, the clatter  
of chess pieces and glass  
cascading, one by one,  
a false embrace, a stilted  
Irish tongue,  

There are no trains here, just  
walk, walk, walk,  
the train passes. You and  
the musk lifting away. Left  
back, a stilted stone.
