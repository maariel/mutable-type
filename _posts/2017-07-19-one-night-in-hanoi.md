A stilted stone, perched still  
on the tracks. Pacing  
arches on the platform,  
as air whistles: You sway,  
you sway.

That is day, when dusk stutters  
we stagger in lurches  
ebb sideways in space-time    
outside repose. Yes,  

the night we met. The clatter  
of chess pieces and glass  
cascading, one by one,  
a false embrace, a stilted  
Irish tongue,  

There are no trains here, just  
walk, walk, walk.  
The train passes. You and  
dawn lifting away. Left  
back, your musk  
and stilted stone.
