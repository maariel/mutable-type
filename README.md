# mutable-type
A repository of poetry in progress. Published on GitHub pages. 

The premise is that poetry is constantly reworked to be improved. As a version-control tool, Git seems well-suited for the organic writing process. 

I am curious about Git's practical usage in editing and reworking prose. Each revision is stored as a Git commit, and changes can be viewed through the handy `git diff` feature. 

Note that I am no means good at this. Read at your own risk :)
